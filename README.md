# CU-CellSeg
## ImageJ2 macro for the cell segmentation of multi-channel images

### Segmentation approach
The CU-CellSeg macro implements a "classic" segmentation approach: In short, probability maps for nucleus channels (mandatory) and cell matrix channels (optional) are thresholded and segmented to create individual cellular compartments. Typical nucleus channels would be DAPI, dsDNA, or histone. Cell matrix channels could contain cytoplasm markers (beta-tubulin, keratin, vimentin, ...) or membrane markers (V-ATPase, HLA class 1, CD8, ...), or both. If no cell matrix channel is specified, cell outlines are generated by expanding the nuclei outlines by a fixed radius. Both cell matrix options generate non-overlapping cell outlines.
