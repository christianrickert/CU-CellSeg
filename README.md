# CU-CellSeg
## ImageJ2 macro for the cell segmentation of multi-channel images

### Segmentation approach
The CU-CellSeg macro implements a "classic" cell segmentation approach with a marker-based cell expansion: 

In short, pixel probability maps for nucleus channels (mandatory) and cell matrix channels (optional) are thresholded and segmented by ImageJ's [watershed algorithm](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Watershed) (nuclei) and by the ["Find maxima..." function](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-29.html#sub:Find-Maxima) (cell matrix) to create individual cellular compartments. Typical nucleus channels would be markers for DAPI, dsDNA, or histone. Cell matrix channels could be cytoplasm markers (beta-tubulin, keratin, vimentin, ...) or membrane markers (V-ATPase, HLA class 1, CD8, ...), or both. If no cell matrix channel is specified, cell outlines are generated from the expansion of the nuclei outlines by a fixed radius. Both cell matrix options generate non-overlapping cell outlines.
